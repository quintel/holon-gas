      For this year (2022), the Dutch government has set an extraction limit of 3.9bcm for the
      Groningen gas field[^1]. However, this decision was made at a different time. There are
      sufficient reserves, so, given that the income is distributed fairly amongst those affected by
      the extraction-induced earthquakes, more Russian gas could be replaced. Several news media
      report that an annual 12bcm extraction cap is considered safe[^2]. Considering the maximum
      annual extraction since 2015 as the technically feasible rate, 27.8bcm of gas could be won per
      annum[^3].

      Bio-methane is a biogas that can directly replace natural gas[^1]. In 2019, this
      injection-rate equalled 4.5%. For this year (2022), the EU wants to double bio-methane
      production under REPowerEU[^2]. When we assume that the injection rate of bio-gas increases
      proportionally, it would provide 9% of the EU’s natural gas as theoretical maximum for our
      reference year. However, we see that the maximum increase in biomethane plants in one year
      (since 2011) is only 33%[^3]. When we take this as realistic estimate, the gas injection rate
      would equal 6% instead.

      According to the IEA’s ten-year plan, 20tWh of generated electricity could be added though a

      theoretical increase of 14.5%.
